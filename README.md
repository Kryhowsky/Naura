# Naura


## Idea
Idea of this project has been created during one of our conversation.

We decided to create a project where we could learn a lot of useful technologies and have the fun.
We would like to build the "To Dos" application, when user can log in, create, modify and delete To Dos.


## Goal
The main goal is to learn:
* Java
* Spring (Spring Boot, Spring JPA, Spring MVC)
* SQL
* Hibernate
* Git (GitHub)
* CI / CD (Server Management)
* jUnit
